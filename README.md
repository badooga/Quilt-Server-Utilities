# Quilt Server Utilities
Building off of [Adrenaserver](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaserver), this modpack takes your server to the next level by optimizing its performance, creating new configuration options to customize it to your liking, and adding new admin commands to make running it as smooth as possible.

## Included Mods
Included in this pack are mods that I thought would be useful for a wide range of servers, working as a foundation for further customization:
- Optimization mods provided by Adrenaserver that improve all aspects of server performance
- Essential server utilities for world pregeneration, anti-xray, privacy, and debugging
- Server management tools for maintenance, scheduling restarts, and world backups
- Configuration options for toggling end/nether portals, mob griefing, and other game rules
- Admin commands for delivering temporary bans/mutes, viewing player inventories, and vanishing from the server list

### Optional Mods
In addition to the core mods of the pack, some optional mods are supplied in case you want to use them. Here are a few examples:
- Simple Voice Chat, for communication between players on the server
- Simple Discord Link, for linking your server chat to a Discord channel and vice versa
- Hey That's Mine and Yet Another World Protector, to protect inventories and land from griefing
- Essential Commands, for plugin commands like `/home` and `/back` on a casual server

A list of mods is given below; mods without checkboxes are optional, and thus are disabled by default in most launchers.

### Notes
For a few of the mods here, a word of caution is adviced:
- While usually very stable, C2ME and VMP are experimental mods, and should be tested to make sure they work well on your server.
- Because of the way it optimizes redstone, Alternate Current can deviate from vanilla behavior, breaking TNT duping and other edge cases.
- Some of the mods here (particularly the optional ones) don't do much by default - you will need to configure them yourself as you see fit. Play around with the settings first before

If you don't want to include a mod for any reason, disabling it will not cause any issues.

## Updates
Updates to this modpack to future game versions are likely, but aren't guaranteed. However, you are free to fork the GitHub repo according to the MIT license.
